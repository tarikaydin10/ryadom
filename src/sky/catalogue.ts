/**
 * Real stars, in their real places.
 *
 * The scattered field is texture; these are not. Each one is a catalogue entry
 * with a right ascension and a declination, put through the same conversion the
 * sun and moon go through, so it stands where it actually stands over the Baltic
 * at the moment shown — turning through the night, and sitting differently in
 * March than in September.
 *
 * Why no Polaris, and no Plough. The band is a view towards the *south* — that
 * is where the sun and the moon are drawn, and the horizontal axis is the angle
 * either side of it. North therefore falls at both edges at once, and the
 * northern circumpolar stars would be pinned against them rather than placed in
 * the sky. The maths is there and correct — Polaris comes out at an altitude
 * equal to the latitude, due north, as it must — but drawing it here would be a
 * true number in a false position.
 *
 * So these look south, and are chosen so that something is always up: the Summer
 * Triangle rules the short nights, Orion the long ones, with the bright singles
 * in between. All of them are visible from both cities on the same evening.
