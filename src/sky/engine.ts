 * picture true: the sun comes up over Kaliningrad, which really does get light
 * about forty minutes earlier, and goes down over Hamburg, which really does
 * keep it longest. The light travels from her side to yours.
 *
 * The two scales cannot both be honest, and this one does not pretend they are.
 * The cities are 10.5° apart — 42 minutes of sun — while a day is 360° and 24
 * hours, so any single axis showing both is off by a factor of about thirty.
 * Placing the cities truly to scale would leave them eleven pixels apart; giving
 * the sun a true scale would park it off-screen for twenty-three hours a day.

 * a landscape painting, and the one thing that must not be wrong — which way
