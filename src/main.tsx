 * deployed fix can sit on the server unseen while the app keeps running last
 * week's code — which is exactly how a working passphrase came to look broken.
 *
 * So: ask for an update whenever the app comes back to the foreground and once
 * an hour, and reload when a new worker actually takes over. `clientsClaim`
 * changes which worker answers future requests; it does not replace the
 * JavaScript already running in this page. Only a reload does that.
