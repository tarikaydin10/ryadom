/**
 * The one-time unlock.
 *
 * The shared secret is *not* compiled into the bundle. It is typed in once, on
 * the first launch of each device, and kept there. That difference matters: a
 * baked-in secret is handed to everyone who opens the URL, whereas this way a
 * stranger who finds the address gets a lock screen, and the server turns them
 * away because they cannot present the secret.
 *
 * What this is: a lock on the front door, so the page is not simply readable by
 * anyone who stumbles onto it. What it is not: encryption. Answers sit
 * unencrypted in this device's database, so whoever holds the unlocked phone
 * reads them. The protection is against strangers, not against someone with your
 * phone in their hand.
