/**
 * One-time coach marks.
 *
 * A gesture that leaves no trace on the screen has to be named once — and only
 * once. A hint that never goes away stops being a hint and becomes furniture,
 * and the reader learns to look past exactly the spot you wanted them to read.
 *
 * Kept on the device rather than in settings, and deliberately not synced: this
 * is a fact about whether the person holding this phone has done the gesture
 * yet, not a preference the two of them share.
